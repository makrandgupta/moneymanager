# OpHopeWeb
Operation Hope workshop on financial literacy incorporating web development skills

#### Side Notes:
- Using semantic temporarily for quick development. Can migrate to custom CSS as needed
- Goal is to have this workshop run completely offline in the worst case. So have added assets to the repo instead of using a CDN
