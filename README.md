# OpHopeWeb
Operation Hope workshop on financial literacy incorporating web development skills

## Installation
1. [Download ZIP](https://github.com/wearhacks/OpHopeWeb/archive/master.zip) file of this repo
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Open the OpHopeWeb-master folder
2. Open index.html

#### Side Notes:
- Using semantic temporarily for quick development. Can migrate to custom CSS as needed
- Goal is to have this workshop run completely offline in the worst case. So have added assets to the repo instead of using a CDN
